# ProCase
Protective Case

This is a project made for my final year Dissertation. A mobile phone case which uses 4 rotating "legs" which rotate as soon as the device reaches a specific height, using an acceleration sensor. Then these "legs" are deployed and rotate from horizontal to vertical position in order to absorb the impact from the fall.
